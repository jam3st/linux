	  Kernel-level support for the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)
	  introduced in XFree86 4.0. If you say Y here, you need to select
	  the module that's right for your graphics card from the list below.
	  These modules provide support for synchronization, security, and
	  DMA transfers. Please see <http://dri.sourceforge.net/> for more
	  details.  You should also select and configure AGP
	  (/dev/agpgart) support if it is available for your platform.

config DRM_DP_AUX_CHARDEV
	bool "DRM DP AUX Interface"
	depends on DRM
	help
	  Choose this option to enable a /dev/drm_dp_auxN node that allows to
	  read and write values to arbitrary DPCD registers on the DP aux
	  channel.

	depends on STACKTRACE_SUPPORT
	select STACKDEPOT
	help
	  Enable allocation tracking of memory manager and leak detection on
	  shutdown.

	  Recommended for driver developers only.

	  If in doubt, say "N".

	  This option provides a kernel module that can be used to test
	  the DRM range manager (drm_mm) and its API. This option is not
	  useful for distributions or general kernels, but only for kernel
	  developers working on DRM and associated drivers.

	  If in doubt, say "N".

	default y
	help
	  Choose this option if you have a need for the legacy fbdev
	  support. Note that this support also provides the linux console
	  support on top of your modesetting driver.

	  If in doubt, say "Y".

config DRM_FBDEV_OVERALLOC
	int "Overallocation of the fbdev buffer"
	depends on DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION
	default 100
	help
	  Defines the fbdev buffer overallocation in percent. Default
	  is 100. Typical values for double buffering will be 200,
	  triple buffering 300.

config DRM_LOAD_EDID_FIRMWARE
	bool "Allow to specify an EDID data set instead of probing for it"
	depends on DRM
	help
	  Say Y here, if you want to use EDID data to be loaded from the
	  /lib/firmware directory or one of the provided built-in
	  data sets. This may be necessary, if the graphics adapter or
	  monitor are unable to provide appropriate EDID data. Since this
	  feature is provided as a workaround for broken hardware, the
	  default case is N. Details and instructions how to build your own
	  EDID data are given in Documentation/EDID/HOWTO.txt.

config DRM_TTM
